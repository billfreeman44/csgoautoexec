Age: old
MM Rank: GE
mic: obviously yes
EFF: like 11 or something.
Role: Rifler "support". Strat caller if needed.  
My awping is fine though I wouldn't want to be the main awper.
Some maps work better with two awpers so I would make a good second awper.
Location: west coast
Times online: 7 or 8 to midnight PST (10-3 east)
Best maps: overpass and mirage
Worst map: cache 
Favorite maps: mill and contra (RIP)
Other extra info: I refuse to do ESEA because they suck.

I want a team who I can have fun with but are also focused on improving and solid play. 

Effective communication and calls are critical to me.  

I don't mind being a backup. Just make everything clear.

Rank, eff/RWS, and age don't really matter to me 
but if there is a large skill disparity it might not be a good team.
